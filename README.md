This repository hosts the following crates:

- [`lexpr`](./lexpr), providing the `lexpr::Value` type for
  representing S-expression data, the `sexp` macro to embed
  S-expression values into Rust code, as well as a parser and printer
  for S-expressions. Please refer to crate's
  [`README`](./lexpr/README.md) for more information.

- [`serde-lexpr`](./serde-lexpr), integrating `lexpr` with Serde,
  allowing to serialize and deserialize Rust data structures to and
  from S-expressions.

- [`lexpr-macros`](./lexpr-macros), an internal crate actually
  implementing the `sexp` macro. This crate should be considered an
  implementation detail, and not be used directly, only via the
  `lexpr` crate.
