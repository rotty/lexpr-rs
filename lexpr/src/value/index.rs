// The usual semantics of Index is to panic on invalid indexing.
//
// That said, the usual semantics are for things like Vec and BTreeMap which
// have different use cases than Value. If you are working with a Vec, you know
// that you are working with a Vec and you can get the len of the Vec and make
// sure your indices are within bounds. The Value use cases are more
// loosey-goosey. You got some S-expression from an endpoint and you want to
// pull values out of it. Outside of this Index impl, you already have the
// option of using value.as_array() and working with the Vec directly, or
// matching on Value::Array and getting the Vec directly. The Index impl means
// you can skip that and index directly into the thing using a concise
// syntax. You don't have to check the type, you don't have to check the len, it
// is all about what you expect the Value to look like.
//
// Basically the use cases that would be well served by panicking here are
// better served by using one of the other approaches: get and get_mut,
// as_array, or match. The value of this impl is that it adds a way of working
// with Value that is not well served by the existing approaches: concise and
// careless and sometimes that is exactly what you want.
